# A Flutter Stopwatch

This is a Flutter project that attempts to follow this product specification:

You work for a company that makes stopwatches. Oftentimes, though, a given stopwatch evolves into something much larger with many additional features beyond what would be considered part of a standard stopwatch. The company would like to be able to deploy to many environments using a single codebase if possible. You have been newly hired and have been asked to build out a production ready, functional, and deployable interface for the base case. Here are the requirements:


- As a user I want to be able to start the stopwatch so that I can begin tracking time
- As a user I want to be able to stop the stopwatch so that I can end tracking time
- As a user I want to be able to optionally track laps
- When tracking laps, I want to know what order they were tracked in
- When tracking laps, I want to know how many there are
- As a user I want to be able to reset the stopwatch
- Resetting means that all laps are reset
- Resetting means that overall time is also reset


The finished product should, at a minimum, build to iOS and Android devices (Simulator/Emulator is okay) and to web displaying a uniform interface and user experience. The finished product should include everything needed for other engineers to work on the product and for the deployment team to deploy the application (into the App or Play stores or to web). The finished product should provide confidence that the application will perform as expected.
